# TODO

- Implement features:
  - Support for video wall mode (tell clients what video geometry to play)
  - Looping
  - Seek
  - Gapless?
  - Support for groups (multi room audio, choose what streams go to what room) -- might be easier to implement as multiple servers
  - Live pipelines (synchronised on RTP timestamps)

- Bugs:
  - Slight out of sync on first seek
