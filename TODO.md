# TODO

- Create an interface for the control server and client, so the TCP
  server/client don't need to be hardcoded.

- Implement features:
  - Pause/Resume
  - Stop
  - Seek
  - Gapless?
  - Support for video wall mode (tell clients what video geometry to play)
  - Support for groups (multi room audio, choose what streams go to what room)
