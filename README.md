# GStreamer Synchronised Network Playback

This is a library to help application developers easily write applications
where multiple devices connected to a network need to play back media in sync.

Use cases include multi-room audio playback, video walls, and any other
situation where it is required that possibly heteregenous devices on a network
need to playback the same audio/video stream.
